- A is an art collector
- [[X]]1 and [[X]]2 are very rare and valuable art objects, the only two in the world
- A owns an objet dâ€™art, [[X]]1; and he buys [[X]]2, as he supposes, which is an exact duplicate of [[X]]1, from [[A-5]], only to discover that he has repurchased [[X]]1 which the scheming [[A-5]] had stolen from his collection
