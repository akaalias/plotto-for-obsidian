### a
- [[8 | 8a]] [[117]] 
- A is in love with B. One evening, as usual, A calls to see B ; but, where her beautiful home had stood, no later than the evening before, there is now only an ancient, timestained tomb—the tomb of B, who had died a hundred years before A was born

### b
- [[7 | 7a]] [[1441 | 1441a]] 
- A, investigating a psychic mystery, falls in love with B
- B, apparently in her early twenties, is dazzlingly beautiful; but she is really very old, and in her case the ravages of time were stayed in early youth by a psychic shock. A’s love dissolves the spell; and, under A’s eyes, B ages and her beauty fades
