Hey there and welcome to Plotto for Obsidian!

## Getting Started
The easiest way to start exploring this vault and pick pieces for your new plot is:

### 1. Create a Scratchpad
1. Create a blank note in "Plots" – This Plot-Note where you'll keep track of interesting nuggets you find along the way
2. Stay in "Editor Mode" so that you can quickly take notes in said Plot-Note
3. Close the file-explorer sidebar as you won't need it

### 2. Use the 'Random Note' Workbench 
![Example Obsidian Workbench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaalias/plotto-for-obsidian/main/workbench.png)

- Open your Plot-Note and Pin it to keep it always there
- Use the top-right file-menu to your Plot-Note "Split Vertically" – You will be opening conflicts and exploring them to the right
- Use the "Random Note" dice-button in the left sidebar to bubble up a random note
- Learn the hotkeys below to follow links, open new panes etc.

### 3. Use Keyboard-First Navigation
- Open in new pane:  `Command-Enter` to follow the link in a new pane
- Go Back: `Command-Left Arrow`
- Go Forward: `Command-Right Arrow`
