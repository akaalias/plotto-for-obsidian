Hey there and welcome to Plotto for Obsidian!

## Getting Started
The easiest way to start exploring this vault and pick pieces for your new plot is:

#### Always Create a Scratchpad
1. Create a blank note in "Plots" – This Plot-Note where you'll keep track of interesting nuggets you find along the way
2. Stay in "Editor Mode" so that you can quickly take notes in said Plot-Note
3. Close the file-explorer sidebar as you won't need it

### Process 1: Start with a Random Note
#### Step 1. Prepare Yur Workbench

- Open your Plot-Note and Pin it to keep it always there
- Use the top-right file-menu to your Plot-Note "Split Vertically" – You will be opening conflicts and exploring them to the right
- Use the "Random Note" dice-button in the left sidebar to bubble up a random note

#### Step 2. Explore and Keep Track
- Now that you have your scratch-pad and random note open, start to EXPLORE!

### Process 2: Using the "Journey" Plugin
- This vault comes with the Journey-plugin[1] pre-installed and pre-configured
- In short, the plugin takes two notes and finds the shortest path between them based on the links that exist between them
- The plugin is configured to only include links of notes in the folder `/Conflicts` and `B-Clauses`

#### Step 1: Plan Your Route
- Option 1: Manually select 3 conflicts (A, B, C) and write down their IDs
- Option 2: Use Journey's "I feel lucky"-Button for random conflicts

#### Step 2: Getting Directions from A to B
- Click on the Journey icon in the left sidebar 
- Enter the full path for conflict A and B
